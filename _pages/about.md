I am a third-year undergraduate student studying Mathematics - Computer Science at UC San Diego. I enjoy playing around with various mathematical tools, and my main interests are within Self-Supervised Machine Learning and Continuous Optimization. 

Selected Experience
======
## Professional  
- *June 2025 - September 2025*  
I will be joining **Amazon** as a **Software Development Engineer (SDE) Intern** for Summer 2025.
## Research  
- *October 2023 - Present*  
**Advisor: Dr. Onat Gungor**  
  - **First author** in an **AAAI-AICS'25** paper proposing a novel method of leveraging Masked Autoencoders and probabilistic vector-to-matrix mappings for self-supervised anomaly detecion in network intrusion detection systems.
  - **Second author** in an **IEEE-CSR'25** publication on evaluating the potential effects of applying adversarial attacks to deep learning models in network intrusion detection.
