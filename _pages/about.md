I am a third-year undergraduate student studying Mathematics - Computer Science at UC San Diego. I enjoy playing around with various mathematical tools, and my main research interests are within Self-Supervised Machine Learning and Continuous Optimization. 

Selected Experience
======
## Professional  
- *June 2025 - September 2025*  
I will be joining **Amazon** as a **Software Development Engineer (SDE) Intern** for Summer 2025.  

## Research  
- Systems Energy and Efficiency Lab at UCSD (*October 2023 - Present*) 
**Advisor: Dr. Onat Gungor**  
  - **First author** in an **AAAI'25 AICS** paper proposing a novel method of leveraging Masked Autoencoders and probabilistic vector-to-matrix mappings for self-supervised anomaly detecion in network intrusion detection systems.
  - **Second author** in an **IEEE-CSR'24** publication on evaluating the potential effects of applying adversarial attacks to deep learning models in network intrusion detection.  

- Scripps Institution of Oceanography (*September 2023 - June 2024*)  
**Advisor: Dr. Tom Corringham**
  - Applied statistical natural language processing techniques and fine-tuned large language models on climate corpora, creating document classification models for regional analysis of prevalent climate issues and the United Nation's 17 SDGs.

## Teaching  
- *April 2023 - June 2023*  
**CS106A (Stanford University)**  
  - Led weekly sections for Stanford University's CS106A (Programming Methodologies), hosting a cohort of 15 students.  

## Projects
- **Bayesian Optimizer**
  - Developing a Python library that implements various Bayesian Optimization techniques. Contains GPU support and allows users to design an (analytical or non-analytical) objective function to minimize/maximize using probabilistic techniques.
