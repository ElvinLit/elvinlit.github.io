I am a third-year undergraduate student studying Mathematicsâ€“Computer Science at UC San Diego. I enjoy exploring various mathematical tools, and my primary research interests lie in Statistics and Machine Learning - whether it be in research, engineering, or infrastructure.  

Selected Experience
======
## Professional  
- **Amazon** (June 2025 - September 2025)  
  *Software Development Engineering Intern*
  - Building software under the Alexa+ team, engineering infrastructure to integrate ML pipelines and new generative AI frameworks into existing Alexa devices.
  - Developing an internal time series modeling service leveraging statistical and deep learning methods to forecast API TPS and diagnose traffic throttling, automating resource scaling to reduce manual developer time efforts by 80%.  

## Research  
- **Systems Energy and Efficiency Lab at UCSD** (October 2023 - Present)  
  *Machine Learning Research Intern*  
  Advisor: Dr. Onat Gungor
  - **First author** in an **IEEE-IoTJ'25** journal publication (under review) proposing a new continual learning framework for machine learning models, fostering continuous online learning capabilities in real-world data streaming scenarios.  
  - **First author** in an **AAAI'25 AICS** research paper proposing a novel method of leveraging Masked Autoencoders and probabilistic vector-to-matrix mappings for self-supervised anomaly detecion in network intrusion detection systems.  
  - **Co author** in an **IEEE-SafeThings'25** research paper presenting a novel selection mechanism for defending against adversarial attacks in the network intrusion domain.  
  - **Second author** in an **IEEE-CSR'24** publication on evaluating the potential effects of applying adversarial attacks to deep learning models in network intrusion detection.


- Scripps Institution of Oceanography (*September 2023 - June 2024*)
  *Natural Language Processing Research Intern*  
  Advisor: Dr. Tom Corringham  
  - Applied statistical natural language processing techniques and fine-tuned large language models on climate corpora, creating document classification models for regional analysis of prevalent climate issues and the United Nation's 17 SDGs.

## Leadership  
- CS106A @ Stanford University (*April 2023 - June 2023*)  
  - Volunteered at Code in Place - led weekly sections for Stanford's CS106A (Programming Methodologies), hosting a cohort of 15 students.
